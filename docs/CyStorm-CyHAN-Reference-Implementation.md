## Document Metadata

- **System Name:** CyStorm  
- **Architecture Model:** C++–Python Hybrid Architecture Network (CyHAN)  
- **Purpose:** Coastal hazard simulation and storm surge modeling platform  
- **Audience:** Scientific software engineers, HPC developers, coastal modelers, system architects

# 1. Introduction

CyStorm is a scientific computing platform designed for high-performance cyclonic storm modeling, probabilistic coastal hazard modeling, AI/ML-enabled metamodeling, and coastal flood mapping.

CyStorm implements the **CyHAN (C++/Python Hybrid Architecture Network)** Standard v1.0 as its governing architectural doctrine.

This document demonstrates how CyStorm conforms to CyHAN through:

- Layer separation  
- Execution authority enforcement  
- Deployment neutrality  
- Performance discipline  
- Multi-frontend support  
- Reproducible compute behavior  

CyStorm serves as a canonical example of CyHAN applied to a scientific engineering system.
